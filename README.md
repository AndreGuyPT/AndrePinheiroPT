Hello! I'm André Pinheiro! I code some programs mainly using Python and JavaScript, though I have some knowledge of C++, C# and HTML/CSS.

Currently I'm working on [CoronaCounter](https://github.com/AndrePinheiroPT/CoronaCounter), an open-source API for connecting all hospitals to register possible coronavirus cases and make posts. It's simple to use, but isn't finished. However, fell free to help with this project.

These last days, I'm learning quantum mechanics, math and HTML/CSS, obviously I have my school where I'm learning biology, philosophy, physics-chemistry and etc... In the future, I want do some projects with the knowledge I'm learning today. Will be open-source and for everyone who wants learn.

I'm looking to collaborate on SuperTux Project, an open-source game based on Super Mario. Because will be good for me to improving my C++ and draw skills and for help the development of the game which I most like. 

Anyone looking to contact me may [email me](mailto:andrepinheiro2004@gmail.com) or find me on Discord as ❖ C4ıηαη Τнε Nεrd ❖#3599.
