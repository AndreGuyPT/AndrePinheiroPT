# André

Hello! I'm André! I code some programs mainly using Python and JavaScript, though I have some knowledge of C++, C# and HTML/CSS.

Currently I'm working on some simulators/experiments, like [Matik](https://github.com/AndrePinheiroPT/Matik), an engine for plot math objects and [Neural Network for T-Rex Game](https://github.com/AndrePinheiroPT/T-Rex-Game-Neural-Network), the t-rex game with a neural network for playing it using genetic algorithm. 
I ever have the goal of make the programs simple and easy to understand.

These last days, I'm learning chess theory, math and HTML/CSS, obviously I have my school where I'm learning biology, philosophy, physics-chemistry and etc... In the future, I want do some projects with the knowledge I'm learning today. Will be open-source and for everyone who wants learn.

I'm looking to collaborate on SuperTux Project, an open-source game based on Super Mario. Because will be good for me to improving my C++ and draw skills and for help the development of the game which I most like. 

Anyone looking to contact me may [email me](mailto:andreftmarcelo@gmail.com).
