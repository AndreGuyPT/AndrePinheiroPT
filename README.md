# André Pinheiro

Hello! I'm André Pinheiro! I code some programs mainly using Python and C++, though I have some knowledge of JavaScript, C# and HTML/CSS.

Currently I'm working on some simulators/experiments, like [Matik](https://github.com/AndrePinheiroPT/Matik), an engine for plot math objects and [Neural Network for T-Rex Game](https://github.com/AndrePinheiroPT/T-Rex-Game-Neural-Network), the t-rex game with a neural network for playing it using genetic algorithm. 
I ever have the goal of make the programs simple and easy to understand.

Anyone looking to contact me may [email me](mailto:andrepinheiro2004@gmail.com).
